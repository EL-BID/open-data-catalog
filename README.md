# Open Data LAC

Open Data LAC is an open data catalog designed to provide centralized access to the Inter-American Development Bank's data resources for Latin America and the Caribbean. It includes datasets, data-driven research publications, datasets that are sources for indicators, and specialized data portals. This version, built using Angular, serves as a temporary implementation before the official platform is fully developed.
