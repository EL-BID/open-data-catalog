The current version of the database, which is now hosted at the IDB, expands its coverage to about 180 countries for 42 years, 1975–2017. Researchers at the World Bank Development Research Group first compiled the database in 2000 (see citation information below). It has become one of the most cited databases in comparative political economy and comparative political institutions. Almost 3000 studies have used this database so far as a source of institutional and political data in their empirical analysis.",

        "description": "Data from the associated Policy Brief. The accelerated aging process that countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are undergoing imposes unprecedented pressures on the long-term care sector. In this context, the growing demand for care from the elderly population occurs alongside a reduction in the availability of informal care. Governments in the region must prepare to address these pressures by supporting the provision of care services to alleviate social exclusion in old age. The Inter-American Development Bank has created an Observatory on Aging and Care — the focus of this policy brief — aimed at providing decision-makers with information to design policies based on available empirical evidence. In this initial phase, the Observatory seeks to document the demographic situation of countries in the region, the health of their elderly population, their limitations and dependency status, as well as their main socioeconomic characteristics. The goal is to estimate the care needs countries in the region will face. This brief summarizes the key findings from an initial analysis of the data. The results highlight the scale of the problem. The figures speak for themselves: in the region, 11% of the population aged 60 and older is dependent. Both the magnitude and intensity of dependency increase with age. Women are the most affected across all age groups. This policy brief is part of a series of studies on dependency care, including works by Caruso, Galiani, and Ibarrarán (2017); Medellín et al. (2018); López-Ortega (2018); and Aranco and Sorio (2018).",

Salaried formal workers contribute to social security and in return have access to an array of benefits -mainly old-age pensions and health services. In recent decades, informal workers – salaried and non-salaried- have gained access to similar benefits, financed through general revenues. Our calculations indicate that, on average, the region spends 1.7% of GDP in these programs. Although they were created in response to social demands, by targeting informal workers these programs may create a behavioral response -i.e. more informality. This paper does not attempt to measure behavioral effects. Its main contribution is to be the first to document this “subsidy to informality” following a common methodology across countries and years in the region.",

During 2017, the IDB Group invested approximately US$4.3 billion in climate finance; that is, in development activities carried out by the public and private sectors that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus mitigate climate change, and/or that reduce vulnerability to climate change and contribute to an adaptation process. This amount represented 28.5% of the IDB Group’s total approvals. Please note that only data from IDB and IDB Lab are available in this dataset.",

The pilot program served as the foundation for the development of the Urban Integration and Coexistence Program (PICU) and was implemented in two neighborhoods of the Central District of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The program did not achieve the expected outcomes regarding women’s empowerment. Treated women continue to request permission from their partners at a higher rate, and no significant impact was observed on decision-making. On a positive note, the program appears to have had a favorable effect on women’s decisions regarding the number of children to have. This suggests that women may have gained greater control and autonomy over their own bodies.",

        "description": "The phenomenon of digital platforms, which has been a major global disruption in the world of work for nearly a decade, is relatively new in Argentina. By early 2016, five platforms operated in the country, all of them domestically owned. Starting that year, due to factors such as the flexibilization of the payment system for international transactions and others, the entry of new platforms and subsidiaries of foreign companies into the Argentine market accelerated. This influx also boosted new investments directed at locally established platforms. ETP18 is a database on the key characteristics of platform economy activities and workers’ perceptions of these platforms in Argentina in 2018. It provides unique insights aimed at generating new knowledge through this research. The survey was conducted with workers from 11 selected platforms: Mercado Libre, Airbnb, Uber, Cabify, Zolvers, Ando, Glovo, Rappi, Workana, Freelancer, and IguanaFix. The database comprises a sample of 603 cases. A triangulation of selection strategies was implemented due to the varying levels of difficulty in accessing workers across platforms. The sample was non-probabilistic, and the number of respondents per platform was determined using uniform quotas, considering the accessibility of workers for each platform.",

The Database of Public Investment Expenditure in Latin America (BDD-GIPAL), available for 16 countries in the region, provides cross-classifications of expenditures (economic, institutional, and functional) for the period 2000-2016. Analysis of BDD-GIPAL helps answer three key questions: How much is invested? Who invests? And in what is it invested? Public investment in the region increased from 2.8% to 3.9% of GDP (2002-2006 vs. 2012-2016); however, this growth was driven by only five countries. Some countries in the region have delegated greater responsibility for public investment spending to subnational governments. In four countries, subnational governments account for over 50% of total public investment expenditure. Nearly 50% of public investment spending in the region has been directed toward transportation infrastructure and housing and community services. In the current context of fiscal constraints across the region, BDD-GIPAL serves as a valuable resource for policymakers and society at large to analyze the prioritization and quality of public investment expenditure.",

        "description": "The Equivalent Fiscal Pressure (EFP) for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 1990-2018, calculated using the IDB-CIAT methodology, measures the total resources collected by the countries of the region. This includes mandatory contributions to private (actuarial) social security systems and non-tax revenues from natural resource exploitation activities. In 2018, the EFP reached 25.2% of GDP, an increase of 0.4% compared to 2017. The sustained increase is based on three fiscal pillars: the Value-Added Tax (VAT), the Income Tax System (ISR), and mandatory Social Security Contributions (SSC), both public and private. From 1990 to 2018, these pillars collectively grew as follows: VAT by 3.4 percentage points of GDP (87.0%), ISR by 2.7 points (77.5%), mandatory SSC by 1.6 points (59.5%), and non-tax revenue from natural resources by 0.7 points (317.5%). Over the most recent five-year period (2013-2018), EFP growth was limited to 1 percentage point of GDP, equivalent to a 4.1% increase. VAT and ISR grew by only 4.8% (to 7.3% of GDP in 2018) and 11.8% (to 6.3% of GDP), respectively, while revenues from natural resources declined by 51.9% (to 1.0% of GDP).",

        "description": "In this study, we examine the regional income distribution in Peru from 1795 to 2017. To achieve this goal, we reconstructed long-term regional GDP and population series for Peru’s 24 departments. These series allowed us to analyze regional income inequality through dimensions such as inequality, modality, mobility, agglomeration, and convergence. The results indicate a persistent increase in regional inequality in Peru from the second half of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century. The Gini coefficient, which measures regional inequality, shows a value of 0.2613 for 1795 and 0.3626 for 2017, with the highest value of 0.4283 recorded in 1934. The regional income distribution is bimodal, with no mobility between the extremes. For instance, the probability that a department poor in 1795 remains poor in 2017 is 94%, while the probability of a rich region remaining rich is 95%. However, significant mobility is observed among departments occupying the middle of the distribution. Additionally, the beta convergence rate from 1795 to 2017 was 1.62%, compared to 1.30% in the 19th century and 1.05% in the 20th century. Using Quantile Regressions (QR), we found that the convergence speed for the entire analysis period ranges from 0.5% to 3.22%, depending on the quantile analyzed. In contrast, using Markov-Switching models (MS), we found a convergence speed exceeding 10%, contrary to previous empirical findings. Finally, the impact of geographic variables on convergence speed varies depending on the statistical method used and the period analyzed.",

The quantity dimension measures how many people wish to work (labor force participation) and how many are actually employed (employment rate). The quality dimension assesses how much of the work generated is registered in social security systems (formality) and how many workers earn wages sufficient to lift them above the poverty line (sufficient wages). Through the Better Jobs Index, the Inter-American Development Bank aims to provide countries with a new instrument to more effectively monitor employment conditions, facilitate cross-country comparisons, and promote policies that lead to more favorable employment conditions.",

        "description": "Very few developing countries have long-term longitudinal surveys that have followed children from the early years throughout their adult life, with low attrition rates and large sample sizes. This type of survey is essential to understand what are critical times in the life cycle when gaps in different dimensions of human capital emerge and how they evolve over time and affect later outcomes. The Ecuador longitudinal survey started in 2003 and has had 5 subsequent follow-ups: 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2019. This data set contains the first five of them. A large number of papers has been written using this data (Paxson and Schady 2007; Paxson and Schady 2010 ; Schady 2006; Fernald and Hidrobo 2011 ; Schady 2011 ; Schady 2012; Schady, Behrman et al. 2015; Berlinsky and Schady, 2015; Araujo, Bosch, Maldonado and Schady 2017; Araujo, Bosch and Schady 2016, and others). All rounds of the survey administered tests to measure different areas of child development (cognition, language, fine and gross motor skills, and socio emotional development). Tests that were selected were appropriate for childrens age and piloted and adapted to the local context. For kids who attended school, the survey also included other assessments of their learning outcomes (language and mathematics) as well as of executive function.",

        "description": "The Living Conditions and Social Development Survey (LCSDS) aims to evaluate and monitor the economic and social conditions, as well as poverty levels, in the communes near the Caracol Industrial Park (PIC). Located 25 km southeast of Cap-Haïtien (Haiti’s second most populous city), the PIC is a flagship economic development initiative that, by 2017, had created 10,000 new jobs in the light manufacturing sector. Between 2001 and 2003, the Haitian Institute of Statistics and Informatics (IHSI) conducted its first and only comprehensive survey on living conditions. The purpose of that survey was to establish baseline development indicators on topics such as housing and infrastructure, demographics, migration, education, labor, health, household income, domestic and public life, and agriculture. No similar comprehensive survey on living conditions has been conducted since. The LCSDS adapted the IHSI’s 2001-2003 survey questionnaire, adding specific modules on perceptions and opinions about the PIC and associated changes in the area. The survey was conducted between 2014 and 2015 as part of the implementation of the Emerging and Sustainable Cities Initiative in Northern Haiti.",

The main modules of the questionnaire were standardized across countries to allow data to be pooled and cross-country comparisons to be made. The survey was launched in the first country on March 27, 2020, and most responses were collected during April 2020. Participants were recruited through social media using paid advertising campaigns. The data consists entirely of responses to an online survey and therefore does not collect information on the most vulnerable people, who are likely to lack access to the internet or social media. However, the survey contains information for people from different social strata and subnational regions. In this sense, the data are useful for analyzing different patterns by socioeconomic groups within a country and between countries. The data include weights to correct for potential biases and achieve greater national representativeness. Additionally, weights are included to correct for differences in sample size between countries and provide greater weighting to observations from countries with larger populations.",

It collected data on critical socioeconomic topics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to support policymaking that can help curb the crisis impacts on the populations welfare. It recontacted households that had been interviewed by the Barbados Survey of Living Conditions (BSLC) in 2016 and was phone-based, given the mobility restrictions and social distancing measures in place. It interviewed 896 households and all their members over 29 days during May and June 2020 and gathered information on disease transmission, household finances, labor, income, remittances, spending and social protection programs. The Barbados COVID-19 Survey was designed and implemented by Sistemas Integrales. This report describes the main methodological aspects of the survey, such as sample design, estimation procedures, topics covered by the questionnaire, field organization and quality control.

During 2019, the IDB Group - composed of the IDB, IDB Lab (formerly the Multilateral Investment Fund) and IDB Invest - approved approximately US$5 billion in climate finance, that is, for development activities carried out by the public and private sectors that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus mitigate climate change, and/or that reduce vulnerability to climate change and contribute to an adaptation process.

Therefore, at the core of the initiative is the development of a standardized sovereign debt database to help debt managers, policy makers, and other actors of financial markets, analyze the composition of public debt in LAC. The information presented in this database is provided by the Debt Management Offices of 26 LAC countries in response to a questionnaire specifically created to allow comparability of data. The questionnaire is intended to compile up-to-date standardized statistics to conduct cross-country comparisons over clear, objective, and homogeneous definitions of public debt.",

        "description": "The datasets come from two surveys of Jamaican businesses conducted between May and June 2020. Two sets of self-administered surveys were conducted using Survey Monkey. A very small sample of financial institutions was surveyed to gain perspective on the challenges facing financiers as a result of the pandemic, and their efforts to respond to such challenges. Nine financial institutions completed this survey, and the results were used to complement the information derived from the second and major survey. The second survey targeted non-financial businesses operating in Jamaica. The sample of firms was selected from a list of all registered Jamaican firms, obtained from the Companies Office of Jamaica. A stratified random sample was used based on firm type, region, and sector. Some firms may have also participated in the study through contact made by their respective affiliations, which were approached to endorse the study and encourage their members to engage. A total of 390 firms completed the second survey. A significant degree of representation was achieved across size, type and age of business, sector and location of operation. Good gender representation was also achieved.",

In 2020, the IDB Group - composed of the IDB, IDB Lab (formerly the Multilateral Investment Fund) and IDB Invest - approved US$3.9 billion in climate finance as per the MDB climate finance tracking methodology. This resource is aimed at development activities carried out by the public and private sectors that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus mitigate climate change, and/or that reduce vulnerability to climate change and contribute to an adaptation process. This amount represented 19.5% of the IDB Groups total approved amount for 2020. The IDB only climate finance in 2020 was 15%, equivalent to US$ 2 billion. If the COVID-19 related investments are excluded, the IDB climate finance reached 30%. Changes in demand from countries to respond to the pandemic affected the overall climate finance results by shifting the priority to social and fiscal sectors and to projects that could provide faster liquidity.",

It measures welfare related variables before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic including labor market outcomes, financial literacy, and food security. The survey was executed in November 2020. The Barbados COVID-19 Survey is a project of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). It collected data on critical socioeconomic topics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to support policymaking and help mitigate the crisis impacts on the populations welfare. The first survey round recontacted households interviewed in 2016 by the Barbados Survey of Living Conditions (BSLC) and was conducted by phone due to the mobility restrictions and social distancing measures in place. It interviewed 896 households and all their members over 29 days during May and June 2020 and gathered information about disease transmission, household finances, labor, income, remittances, spending, and social protection programs. Data and documentation of this first round can be found at: https://publications.iadb.org/en/covid-19-household-telephone-survey-barbados. The second round was carried out in November 2020 and recontacted respondent households from the first round. It focused on labor and interviewed 758 households. Both Barbados COVID-19 Survey rounds were designed and implemented by Sistemas Integrales. This publication describes the second rounds main methodological aspects, such as sample design, estimation procedures, topics covered by the questionnaire, field organization and quality control.

It aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations; analyzing gene and protein expression; simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, proteins and biomolecular interactions; and mining of biological literature, among many other critical areas of research. Studies suggest that bioinformatics skills in the Latin American and Caribbean region are relatively incipient, and thus its scientific systems cannot take full advantage of the increasing availability of bioinformatic tools and data. This dataset is a catalog of bioinformatics software for researchers and professionals working in life sciences. It includes more than 300 different tools for varied uses, such as data analysis, visualization, repositories and databases, data storage services, scientific communication, marketplace and collaboration, and lab resource management. Most tools are available as web-based or desktop applications, while others are programming libraries. It also includes 10 suggested entries for other third-party repositories that could be of use.",

The Harmonized Latin American Innovation Surveys Database (LAIS) contains nearly 690 variables and 119,900 observations at the firm level. Data are from 30 national innovation surveys conducted between 2007 and 2017 in 10 Latin American countries. The dataset increases the number of countries of the region with publicly available microdata about innovation at the firm level. The corresponding IDB technical note describes how criteria were applied to identify and select variables, whose data measure the same underlying concept, from substantially diverse innovation survey methods and questionnaires used in different Latin American countries. The availability of these data will allow more scholars to research innovation in Latin American firms and address long-standing unanswered questions about the relative importance a variety of factors driving innovation decisions in Latin American firms.",

        "description": "This is the third update of the Equivalent Fiscal Pressure (EFP) Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) for the period 1990–2018, based on the IDB-CIAT methodology. The EFP provides a more precise measurement of total resources collected in the region and comprises four components: 1.\tTraditional tax revenues from general government, including subnational governments. 2.\tPublic contributions to social security. 3.\tMandatory contributions to private social security schemes. 4.\tNon-tax revenues from natural resource exploitation. Following the upward trend since the 1990s, the average EFP for 25 countries increased by more than 6 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP), rising from 17.3% to 23.6% between 1990 and 2021. Medium-term dynamics are primarily driven by tax revenues, which grew from 13.5% to 18.0% of GDP over the same period. At the individual country level, there is significant heterogeneity in both the evolution and levels of tax revenues and EFP.",

        "description": "The database allows estimating structural fiscal balances for 20 countries in the region under different assumptions regarding the output gap and commodity structural prices. It is a unique database of its kind since: 1) It takes into consideration the distinct responsiveness of different types of revenues to changes in the output gap: In order to adjust for the impact of the business cycle on revenues, we calculate individual elasticities for each source of revenue (i.e. direct taxes, indirect taxes, revenues from non-renewable resources, etc.). Since the different types of revenues in the region have different sensitivities to changes in the output gap, this disaggregated approach allows for a more fine-tuned adjustment. 2) It includes estimations of SFBs based on output gaps projections available in real time. In addition to giving estimations of the actual SFBs, we provide with estimations of the SFBs that would have resulted should the projections on output gaps available to policymakers at the time of designing fiscal policy (data in real time) have been correct. This is in contrast to much of the existing work on structural fiscal balances that makes only an ex post analysis using actual and revised information on the output gaps. 3) It allows assessing the response of fiscal policy to the business cycle. We provide with measures of the fiscal impulse, assessing not only the actual but also the intentional fiscal stance, as well as the degree of procyclicality of fiscal policy.",

The databases contain data collected for the impact evaluation of an intervention designed to explore which mechanisms are more effective in changing people's beliefs and attitudes toward migrants. The experiment was conducted in nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and consisted of two video interventions. The first video, the informative video, aimed to correct misinformation about the impact of migration by providing accurate information about the size of the migrant population and its characteristics. The second video, an emotive video, intended to appeal to the emotions and empathy of the local population.",

Moreover, unlike traditional aggregate indicators, the Sociómetro indicators are disaggregated by ethnicity and race (when available) and by gender, geographic residence, education, and income quintile. The indicators are not intended to serve as official data for any particular country but instead aim to provide a comparable set of social indicators for the Latin American region.",

The project included technical, legal, economic, social and environmental studies. One component was an urban mobility survey, which constitutes the main source of data for the present analysis. Within this framework, we gathered information on the travel patterns and socioeconomic characteristics of residents in June and July 2015. To obtain comparable data and to determine the most common trips, such as from home to work or school and back, we collected data from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and weekends. The sample was collected at the sub-district level (blocks) to cover the districts of La Paz and El Alto, following a random selection process (see Annex 2 for more details). A total of 6,720 inhabitants of La Paz (4,208) and El Alto (2,512) were interviewed from a total of 6,208 households (3,892 and 2,316 in La Paz and El Alto respectively). Participants were surveyed about the last two trips they had made prior to the interview date.",

The Equivalent Fiscal Pressure indicator makes use of a methodology that better reflects the particularities of the mobilization of fiscal resources in the region, and consists of three elements: 1) Traditional tax collection, which includes all taxes and fees levied at all levels of government; 2) Compulsory social security contributions, whether public or private, mostly to pension and health systems; and 3) Non-tax revenues derived from the exploitation of natural resources, whether renewable or not; i.e., fees, royalties, dividends paid and net profits from public enterprises. The information is presented broken down by type of tax at every level of government. The series are adjusted with updated GDP values for each country and information that becomes available for municipalities and social security, which tend to have a longer lag period compared to other tax statistics.",

Once the update list was completed, companies were randomly selected according to size. Our universe includes all small, medium, and large companies in the metropolitan areas of El Alto, La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. Small companies were those with 5 to 20 employees; medium-sized companies were those with 21 to 49 employees; while large companies were those with 50 or more employees. A probabilistic sample design was applied, with allocation proportional to the population size.",

To understand water risk throughout the region, this dataset provides population and land area estimates for factors related to water risk, allowing users to explore vulnerability throughout the region to multiple dimensions of water risk. This dataset contains estimates of populations living in areas of water stress and risk in 27 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) at the municipal level. The dataset contains categories of 18 factors related to water risk and 39 indices of water risk and population estimates within each with aggregations possible at the basin, state, country, and regional level. The population data used to generate this dataset were obtained from the WorldPop project 2020 UN-adjusted population projections, while estimates of water stress and risk come from WRI’s Aqueduct 3.0 Water Risk Framework. Municipal administrative boundaries are from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM). For more information on the methodology users are invited to read IADB Technical Note IDB-TN-2411: “Scarcity in the Land of Plenty”, and WRIs “Aqueduct 3.0: Updated Decision-relevant Global Water Risk Indicators”.",

Currently, the harmonization of Population and Housing Censuses includes databases for 22 countries. The indicators are categorized into seven themes: demographics, education, labor market, housing, income, migration, and diversity. When possible, we add multiple disaggregations for indicators. The available disaggregations are ethnicity, gender, age, education level, and area of geographic residence.

        "description": "The second round of the IDB/Cornell Coronavirus Survey is a follow-up to the first round of the IDB/Cornell Coronavirus Survey, which collected information related to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on labor markets, food security, social distancing, and knowledge about the symptoms and forms of contagion of the Coronavirus. The main objective of the second round was to follow up with households participating in the first round, collecting more detailed information on household income and assets, as well as data on beneficiaries of social programs existing before the pandemic, financial inclusion, political preferences, and behaviors related to Covid-19 in general. The data collection procedure for the second round, as well as its dissemination, were carried out in the same way as for the first round. Data from the two rounds of the survey were combined to create a household-level data panel. By conducting a correlation exercise between participation in the second round and demographic characteristics, we found that being a woman increased the probability of participating in the second round of the survey. Similarly, people with a higher level of education and higher income were more likely to participate in the second round. In line with these results, we also found a positive correlation between being 40 years old or older and participating in the follow-up survey. Panel data are useful for analyzing the effects of the pandemic on more detailed situations and preferences of households within a country and between countries. Weights are included that correct for differences in sample size between countries and provide greater weighting to observations from countries with larger populations.",

The first round of data was collected in 2011 when 1,311 children ages 6-42 months were given the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) by psychologists and were randomized to receive one of two batteries of short tests under survey conditions. In 2016, at 6-8 years, 940 of these children were found and given tests of IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC-V) and school achievement (arithmetic, reading, and vocabulary) by psychologists. These 937 children, excluding outliers, constitute the analysis sample of the paper Predictive validity in middle childhood of short tests of early childhood development used in large scale studies compared to the Bayley-III, the Family Care Indicators, height-for-age, and stunting: A longitudinal study in Bogota, Colombia by Marta Rubio-Codina and Sally Grantham-McGregor, forthcoming at PLOS ONE.

        "dataNotes": "Data from this study are based on 1261 surveys that were applied between May 22nd and June 21st, 2014, seven Centers for Social Rehabilitation in the Federal District (DF) and five of the state of Morelos in Mexico. A transversal survey was conducted through a representative sample of secluded population in seven prisons in the Federal District and five in the state of Morelos, randomly chosen on the basis of a reverse representation probability of their population of visitors. These two states were chosen because, even if they are adjacent, represent two types of centers: those located in urban areas and those located in rural areas. The preliminary design of the sample was performed taking into account the number of visitors to each center (based on records of visits between the months January 2013 and February 2014), from information provided via public information requests by the prison system authorities of the two states studied. This information was granted in February 2014. The survey was conducted in three phases: 1. First phase: the interviewers received a technical and operational training, with the main objective of familiarizing interviewers with the questionnaire, the context of the research and study purposes and limitations. During training they were instructed on how to approach the study subjects, emphasizing the voluntary, free and anonymous participation of respondents, and how to respond to questions and concerns of the participants. The team included 15 interviewers and 3 supervisors, plus a field coordinator. The team had extensive experience in prison studies, reflected in their education studies of undergraduate and masters specialized in Criminology: Social Work, Anthropology, Psychology and Sociology. During this first phase further efforts were made with the relevant authorities to achieve permanency in the centers studied, ensuring safety conditions for both interviewers and participants of the study. 2. Second phase: a pilot test was conducted in two centers in the Federal District to test the questionnaire, the clarity of language, and the extension. This test allowed to make changes to the questionnaire, and to calculate the percentage of \"no answers\". One of the key objectives of the pilot will be to test the possibility of an exit survey, which would have information on the immediate experience of the subjects. For the pilot surveys 30 surveys were conducted at two centers in the Federal District. The surveys used in the pilot were not used in the final results. 3. Third phase: field survey. Surveys were applied face to face to men and women, once they had completed their visits to the center; the survey was voluntary under the promise of anonymity. The surveys were conducted on Saturdays and Sundays. The collection in the Federal District employed 16 interviewers and 4 supervisors, and in Morelos, 14 interviewers and 4 supervisors. For the selection of the subjects a systematic sampling, with a random start, at each center, each day. (Ex. 2, 7, 9, 18, 22, 23, etc ... until completing the sample). Each day began with an initial random number. The field supervisor used a table of random numbers daily at each center to ensure random selection of subjects. Given the number of surveys conducted in different centers, the study does not allow comparison between centers, but it does allow comparison between states. The information processing was carried out simultaneously with the field survey. The sample was designed by Dr. Carlos Vilalta, Research Professor, Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), based on information about visitors provided by the authorities of each state. In both states, coordination was carried out by Dr. Catalina Pérez Correa and Dra. Maria Cristina Monta√±o.",

Is housing connected?, iv.\tIs housing green and sustainable?, v. Is housing a secure asset? Data has been compiled from the top four global databases: the Housing Finance and Information Network (HOFINET); Global Housing Policy Indicators (GHPI) of Habitat for Humanity International; United Nations: Compendium of Housing Statistics (UNCHS); and the World Bank World Development Indicators (WB-WDI). Further, data from national census agencies has been included and the platform includes indicators obtained from specific surveys collected in areas where data is not available. Some indicators are calculated from metadata contained in other sources. Notes and sources are included for every data point which explains where the data is from and, if applicable, how it was calculated. The indicators are presented in a format that allows for comparison across the national, metropolitan, and local levels wherever possible. However, it is the responsibility of the user to determine if it is appropriate to compare. The dataset contains the most recent data available to the working group and its partners.",

Each dimension has multiple factors which contribute towards a more mature state of cybersecurity capacity. Each factor then has several levels of indicators that describe a state of maturity (Startup, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic). The different levels of maturity listed prompt the researchers to select the level that is most applicable to the experience of cybersecurity in the country based on a thorough policy analysis.

        "description": "Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year’s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development—physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional— does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children’s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.",

Thus, the structure of this questionnaire, forming the database, is based on the concept that there are five intervening elements in the process of public value creation, namely: 1) results-based planning, 2) results-based budgeting, 3) financial management, audit, and procurement, 4) program and project management, and, 5) monitoring and evaluation. These elements, called pillars of the management cycle, are broken down in a set of components that describe the maturity of the institutional systems. In turn, the components consist of indicators and requirements that these institutions, systems and processes should have in an MfDR environment. The questionnaire includes four kinds of requirements: those that measure compliance of a condition, those that indicate a percentage, the special cases, and those that request additional information. (1)\tRequirements that measure compliance are the predominant type of requirements in this questionnaire. The requirements that measure compliance specify the situation that must occur in order to be considered fully or partially compliant. However, some of these types of requirements do not include partial compliance, only fully compliance and non-compliance. (2)\tRequirements that measure percentages specify the calculation that should be performed. (3)\tThis questionnaire includes three requirements considered special cases because they are neither part of those that measure compliance, nor of those that measure percentages. All these cases are tha calculation of number of average days. (4)\tFinally, there are a very restricted number of requirements in which is asked to provide additional information. For example, the number of persons who work in an entity or unit.",

The study finds that the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region lags well behind other regions in terms of financial depth, as measured by gross private domestic financial assets. LAC countries also have a larger share of bank deposits and cash in the private sector portfolio, compared to non-bank assets (bonds and shares). Moreover, within the institutional investor industry, pension funds are relatively developed in the region, although they grew out of the compulsory pension systems in several countries that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that LAC countries have about 40 percent of gross private financial wealth invested abroad, but just 4 percent of gross private liabilities have that origin, which attests to region’s obstacles in tapping international markets. The countries in general present a small share of household and business saving being intermediated through the financial system. In the specific case of bank deposits, just 5 percent of household saving and 3 percent of business saving are kept in the banking system.",

Each dimension has multiple factors which contribute towards a more mature state of cybersecurity capacity. Each factor then has several levels of indicators that describe a state of maturity (Startup, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic). The different levels of maturity listed prompt the respondent to select the level that is most applicable to the experience of cybersecurity in the country. The results of the analysis were then sent to each country for validation. For more details please review the ‚ÄúAppendix: Detailed Methodological Framework‚Äù included in the 2016 Cybersecurity Report. ",

        "description": "The main goal of the IDBA is to size the Digital Divide in Latin America and the Caribbean by measuring the state of broadband development in the 26 Bank-member countries, as well as in additional reference countries (64 nations in total). The IDBA is a powerful tool to identify the magnitude of the gap in two different geographic approached, first when we compare the state of the art of one country versus the cluster region the country belongs to, and second, when we compare the country with respect to the OECD. The IDBA relies on a comprehensive approach based on four pillars: infrastructure, applications and capacity, strategic regulations, and public policy and strategic vision. Those four pillars are built as a result of the combination of 37 indicators from renowned international institutions. As a result, the IDBA provides a tool for decision makers and policymakers to detect, on a country basis, strengths and areas for improvement in developing specific, concrete and actionable plans.",

The citizen security indicators were designed, reviewed and approved by the project's partner countries, along with established definitions and methodologies for the standardizing of  the collecting, processing and analyzing stages of the information flow in order to support the quality of the data published. These indicators were reviewed in various regional boards, resulting in the improvement of some of them and the selection of additional citizen security indicators. The indicators are obtained via administrative records and others via surveys. In order to ensure the comparability of the indicators, a standardization process of concepts relating to the variables of time, place, person and circumstance was developed.",

In recent years, progress has been made towards increasing total revenue, but most countries in the region still lag well behind other countries with similar levels of development. More importantly, Latin America policymakers still largely ignore the potential of taxation to contribute to other important development goals. Governments have repeatedly missed the chance to influence consumption and production patterns by using taxes to effect relative price changes. More than Revenue aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the current state of taxation in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region, its main reform needs, and possible reform strategies that take into account the likely economic, institutional, and political constraints on the reform process.",

The IDB supported the design of a methodology that evaluates critical points to assess the civil services and carried out country evaluations in 2004. Between 2011 and 2013, a second group of diagnostics second group of diagnostics were completed (with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank, and in the case of Central American countries and Dominican Republic with the support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development –AECID- and the Central American Integration System-SICA). Scores are available for 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 (year of second and/or third measurement varies per country). In 2015, 2017 and 2019, the IDB completed the third series of diagnosis. During the first assessment, 93 critical points were identified; each of those fed a subsystem and an index. In 2010 the methodology was simplified to 33 critical points and the base line was recalibrated to ensure comparability. The methodology is based in the identification of critical points that feed 8 subsystems: 1. Human Resources Planning, 2. Work Organization, 3. Employment management, 4. Performance management, 5. Compensation management, 6. Development management, 7. Human and social relations management, 8. HR Function organization; and 5 indexes: 1. Efficiency, 2. Merit, 3. Structural consistency, 4. Functional capacity, and 5. Integrating capacity.",

Nonetheless, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of their impact. This document discusses the normative merits of using MTFs, provides a characterization of the different types of MTF, and describes their development in the Latin American region based on extensive field work. As a first approximation for understanding how they are working, this document explores in detail the cases of Argentina, Colombia and Peru. While an unambiguous diagnosis is not possible, this document lays the groundwork for progress toward comprehensive impact evaluations and, eventually, to the consolidation of MTFs in the region.",

        "description": "The Brazilian Electoral Panel Study (BEPS) was designed primarily to capture campaign dynamics at the national level during the 2010 Brazilian presidential election. It aimed at generating data that make it possible to i) measure electoral volatility at the individual level during political campaigns, and ii) explore the ways in which both short and long-term factors affect this process and the ultimate vote decision. The Brazilian Electoral Panel Study is composed of three waves conducted in March and April, August, and November of 2010. The first wave was implemented about six months prior to the first round of the election and before the official launch of the political campaign that began in July with the nomination of candidates. It was conducted as part of the 2010 AmericasBarometer of the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP). Wave Two of the survey predated the beginning of the Free Electoral Airtime (Hor√°rio Gratuito de Propaganda Eleitoral or HGPE), in which candidates for all offices have 45 minutes of daily access to television broadcasting during prime-time hours. Finally, Wave Three was carried out immediately after the second round of the election, which occurred on October 31. The panel sought to establish baseline measures of vote intention, policy preferences, and several related factors, following longstanding debates on electoral behavior in Latin America and the United States.",

Stagnating Economic Growth in the Caribbean on the following topics: economic growth, small economies, caribbean, productivity, competitiveness, macroeconomic instability. This report addresses several critical questions regarding Caribbean nations. Does size matter for economic growth and volatility? To what degree has Caribbean economic growth been inferior to that of ROSE? What could account for the Caribbean growth gap and what economic policies might decision-makers adopt to promote higher and sustainable growth?. The central focus is on six countries in the region, which will be referred to as the C6: The Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. However, the analysis will sometimes include, most often in the aggregate, the countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The six members of the OECS used in this report are Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The report was prepared by members of the Caribbean Economics Team (CET) of the Country Department Caribbean (CCB) of the Inter-American Development Bank.",

        "description": "This dataset contains the tables and figures for the 2016 edition of Development in the Americas. Book description: Why should people--and economies--save? The typical answer usually focuses on the need to protect against future shocks, to smooth consumption during hard times, in short, to save for the proverbial rainy day. This book approaches the question from a slightly different angle. While saving to survive the bad times is important, saving to thrive in the good times is what really counts. People must save so they can invest in their own and their children's health and education, live productive fulfilling lives, and end their days in comfort and peace. Firms must save so they can grow productive enterprises that employ more workers in better jobs to produce quality goods for domestic and international markets. Governments must save to build bridges, highways, and airports that support a productive economy, to provide quality services such as education, health, water, and sanitation to their citizens, and to assure their senior citizens a dignified, worry-free retirement. In short, countries must save for a sunny day -a time when everyone can bask in the benefits of growth, prosperity, and well-being.",

Study participants were 749 women callers (459 treatment and 290 controls) who had called the hotline between September 2013 and May 2014. Data was collected once, between October and December of 2014, 6 months to one year after the women´s calls to the hotline, with reports of 2013 violence being retrospective. The survey asked participants to report violence in the 3 months leading up to their call to the hotline and then 3 months prior to the data collection. For the moment, this download will prove data formatted only for Stata. Inside, you will find the survey data as well as the do files to assign names to the variables and the labels for the response options.",

        "description": "Jobs are essential for the growth of individuals and countries alike. Achieving personal fulfillment is harder without a job, just as an economy as a whole cannot develop without the impetus of the labor market. These two perspectives unquestionably go hand in hand: from the individual perspective, finding a good job is a legitimate aspiration for anyone who wishes to support oneself and one's family; from the societal perspective, creating more and better jobs is essential to the achievement of lasting and equitable growth. Jobs for Growth rests on this dual vision. This book examines the performance of the region's labor market and, based on this analysis, proposes an integrated package of measures for both personal growth (through successful career paths) and economic growth (through more high-quality jobs and higher productivity). Over the past two decades, the bullish economic cycle has yielded undeniable gains for labor markets in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), among them lower unemployment, improved job creation, and a substantial increase in wages. However, the situation on the horizon -stagnation of the region's growth and weaknesses in the global macroeconomic outlook- have increased the urgency to find solutions to today's most pressing labor problems. This volume shows that, despite the still-low unemployment rates, the region may find itself trapped in a vicious cycle of poor-quality jobs -a phenomenon especially visible in the high percentage of informal jobs (which are defined in this publication as those without access to social security benefits) and in the high proportion of very short-lived jobs. As the title Jobs for Growth indicates, breaking this cycle will require comprehensive policies that boost productivity.",

        "description": "What do we know about the effects of improved access to electricity? Does the research tell a unified story? To answer these questions, this brief examines 50 impact evaluation studies, focusing on the effects of electrification on education, labor, and income indicators. Overall, the literature finds substantial welfare gains, which tend to be greatest for women and small firms. On average, electrification leads increases of around 7% in school enrollment, 25% in employment, and 30% in incomes. However, the estimates vary widely, with many studies finding no effects, indicating weak links in the empirical literature. This review suggests that addressing the sources of such variance could be a means to fill the persistent knowledge gaps and to improve the effectiveness of electrification policies.",

        "description": "This paper presents new data documenting the cost of salaried labor in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries. We gather data on the three main costs associated to hiring salaried labor; (i) minimum wages and other monetary benefits, (ii) mandated contributions for social insurance and other benefits and (iii) job security provisions. We present two new indicators. First, we calculate the average non-wage cost of salaried labor (NWC). This indicator answers the following question: for the average wage, what additional share of wages must be satisfied by workers and employers to fulfill all the law mandated non-wage costs of a legal salaried relationship. Our second indicator combines these non-wage costs with the nominal restriction that legal wages cannot be lower than the minimum wage. We calculate the annual dollar value of paying a worker the minimum wage plus all mandated non-wage costs as a share of GDP per worker. This constitutes the minimum cost of salaried labor (MCSL). We highlight seven important facts; (i) The average non-wage cost of salaried labor (NWC) for the region is 49% of wages. (ii) There is a large dispersion across countries like Argentina, Brazil and Peru with costs around 70% of wages and countries like Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Chile with cost less than 40% of wages. (iii) Mandatory contributions are the most important component of the average non-wage cost of salaried labor with 27.3% of wages followed by additional benefits with 13.8% of wages while job security provisions account for another 8.4%. (iv) On average, mandated contributions from employers amount to 17.5% of average annual wages, versus 9.8% of mandated contributions from employees. (v) The minimum cost of salaried labor (MCSL) is on average 39% of GDP per worker. (vi) Variation of the MCSL across countries is even larger. For countries like Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago or the Dominican Republic the MCSL it is below 15% of GDP per worker while the minimum cost of hiring a salaried worker in Honduras is 95% of GDP per capita. (vii) Despite having below average NWC, the five poorest countries in our sample are those presenting the highest MCSL, due to high minimum wages relative to GDP per worker.",

This is why at the core of the LAC Debt Group initiative is the development of a standardized sovereign debt database to help debt managers, policy makers, and other actors of financial markets analyze the evolution and composition of public debt in LAC and conduct cross-country comparisons. The information of the database is provided by the public debt offices of LAC countries in response to a questionnaire specifically designed to allow comparability of data. The questionnaire, whose response is non-compulsory, is intended to compile up-to-date standardized statistics for objective and homogeneous definitions of public debt.",
