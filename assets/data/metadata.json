While the Sociómetro includes traditional global indicators, the database also includes tailor-made indicators in five areas: Demographics, Education, Labor Market, Housing, and Income, to better capture conditions in LAC. Moreover, unlike traditional aggregate indicators, the Sociómetro indicators are disaggregated by ethnicity and race (when available) and by gender, geographic residence, education, and income quintile. The management and implementation of the Sociómetro are provided by the Social Sector (SCL) of the Vice Presidency of Knowledge and Sectors to strengthen the analytical content of projects and studies. The indicators are not intended to serve as official data for any particular country but instead aim to provide a comparable set of social indicators for the Latin American region.",

        "description": "In 2012, the IDB approved a project to support the preparation of a comprehensive public transport system for the metropolitan area of ​​La Paz and El Alto. The project included technical, legal, economic, social and environmental studies. One component was an urban mobility survey, which constitutes the main source of data for the present analysis. Within this framework, we gathered information on the travel patterns and socioeconomic characteristics of residents in June and July 2015. To obtain comparable data and to determine the most common trips, such as from home to work or school and back, we collected data from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and weekends. The sample was collected at the sub-district level (blocks) to cover the districts of La Paz and El Alto, following a random selection process (see Annex 2 for more details). A total of 6,720 inhabitants of La Paz (4,208) and El Alto (2,512) were interviewed from a total of 6,208 households (3,892 and 2,316 in La Paz and El Alto respectively). Participants were surveyed about the last two trips they had made prior to the interview date.",

        "description": "The Database of Political Institutions presents institutional and electoral results data such as measures of checks and balances, tenure and stability of the government, identification of party affiliation and ideology, and fragmentation of opposition and government parties in the legislature, among others. The current version of the database, which is now hosted at the IDB, expands its coverage to about 180 countries for 40 years, 1975-2015. Researchers at the World Bank Development Research Group first compiled the database in 2000 (see citation information below). It has become one of the most cited databases in comparative political economy and comparative political institutions. Almost 3000 studies have used this database so far as a source of institutional and political data in their empirical analysis.",

The Equivalent Fiscal Pressure indicator makes use of a methodology that better reflects the particularities of the mobilization of fiscal resources in the region, and consists of three elements: 1) Traditional tax collection, which includes all taxes and fees levied at all levels of government; 2) Compulsory social security contributions, whether public or private, mostly to pension and health systems; and 3) Non-tax revenues derived from the exploitation of natural resources, whether renewable or not; i.e., fees, royalties, dividends paid and net profits from public enterprises. The information is presented broken down by type of tax at every level of government. The series are adjusted with updated GDP values for each country and information that becomes available for municipalities and social security, which tend to have a longer lag period compared to other tax statistics.",

The current version of the database, which is now hosted at the IDB, expands its coverage to about 180 countries for 42 years, 1975–2017. Researchers at the World Bank Development Research Group first compiled the database in 2000 (see citation information below). It has become one of the most cited databases in comparative political economy and comparative political institutions. Almost 3000 studies have used this database so far as a source of institutional and political data in their empirical analysis.",

The databases contain data collected for the impact evaluation of an intervention designed to explore which mechanisms are more effective in changing people's beliefs and attitudes toward migrants. The experiment was conducted in nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and consisted of two video interventions. The first video, the informative video, aimed to correct misinformation about the impact of migration by providing accurate information about the size of the migrant population and its characteristics. The second video, an emotive video, intended to appeal to the emotions and empathy of the local population.",

A pre-selection of the companies to be visited was made using the information from the Public Business Registry Service (SEPREC) as a framework, then, using these surveys as a parameter, areas were delimited so that, in the first instance and before carrying out the visit, an update list of each area is made to identify possible informal companies that are not included in the SEPREC database. Once the update list was completed, companies were randomly selected according to size. Our universe includes all small, medium, and large companies in the metropolitan areas of El Alto, La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. Small companies were those with 5 to 20 employees; medium-sized companies were those with 21 to 49 employees; while large companies were those with 50 or more employees. A probabilistic sample design was applied, with allocation proportional to the population size.",

        "description": "LAC is the most water-rich region in the world by most metrics; however, water resource distribution throughout the region does not correspond demand. To understand water risk throughout the region, this dataset provides population and land area estimates for factors related to water risk, allowing users to explore vulnerability throughout the region to multiple dimensions of water risk. This dataset contains estimates of populations living in areas of water stress and risk in 27 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) at the municipal level. The dataset contains categories of 18 factors related to water risk and 39 indices of water risk and population estimates within each with aggregations possible at the basin, state, country, and regional level. The population data used to generate this dataset were obtained from the WorldPop project 2020 UN-adjusted population projections, while estimates of water stress and risk come from WRI’s Aqueduct 3.0 Water Risk Framework. Municipal administrative boundaries are from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM). For more information on the methodology users are invited to read IADB Technical Note IDB-TN-2411: “Scarcity in the Land of Plenty”, and WRIs “Aqueduct 3.0: Updated Decision-relevant Global Water Risk Indicators”.",

The main objective of the second round was to follow up with households participating in the first round, collecting more detailed information on household income and assets, as well as data on beneficiaries of social programs existing before the pandemic, financial inclusion, political preferences, and behaviors related to Covid-19 in general. The data collection procedure for the second round, as well as its dissemination, were carried out in the same way as for the first round. Data from the two rounds of the survey were combined to create a household-level data panel. By conducting a correlation exercise between participation in the second round and demographic characteristics, we found that being a woman increased the probability of participating in the second round of the survey. Similarly, people with a higher level of education and higher income were more likely to participate in the second round. In line with these results, we also found a positive correlation between being 40 years old or older and participating in the follow-up survey. Panel data are useful for analyzing the effects of the pandemic on more detailed situations and preferences of households within a country and between countries. Weights are included that correct for differences in sample size between countries and provide greater weighting to observations from countries with larger populations.",

This dataset makes extensive new survey data available to help identify what anti-crime policies citizens in the region demand from their governments, as well as who is demanding what and why. This dataset accompanies a recent report on Combating Crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, https://publications.iadb.org/en/combating-crime-latin-america-and-caribbean-what-public-policies-do-citizens-want. Data from Americas Barometer study were collected in 2016–17 and refer to the subsample of 17 countries in Latin America. The IADB–LAPOP–Capital Cities Project includes data collected from 2017, between August and September. A total of 6,040 interviews in seven countries were conducted as part of the project (Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay).

The first round of data was collected in 2011 when 1,311 children ages 6-42 months were given the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) by psychologists and were randomized to receive one of two batteries of short tests under survey conditions. In 2016, at 6-8 years, 940 of these children were found and given tests of IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC-V) and school achievement (arithmetic, reading, and vocabulary) by psychologists. These 937 children, excluding outliers, constitute the analysis sample of the paper Predictive validity in middle childhood of short tests of early childhood development used in large scale studies compared to the Bayley-III, the Family Care Indicators, height-for-age, and stunting: A longitudinal study in Bogota, Colombia by Marta Rubio-Codina and Sally Grantham-McGregor, forthcoming at PLOS ONE.

        "dataNotes": "Data from this study are based on 1261 surveys that were applied between May 22nd and June 21st, 2014, seven Centers for Social Rehabilitation in the Federal District (DF) and five of the state of Morelos in Mexico. A transversal survey was conducted through a representative sample of secluded population in seven prisons in the Federal District and five in the state of Morelos, randomly chosen on the basis of a reverse representation probability of their population of visitors. These two states were chosen because, even if they are adjacent, represent two types of centers: those located in urban areas and those located in rural areas. The preliminary design of the sample was performed taking into account the number of visitors to each center (based on records of visits between the months January 2013 and February 2014), from information provided via public information requests by the prison system authorities of the two states studied. This information was granted in February 2014. The survey was conducted in three phases: 1. First phase: the interviewers received a technical and operational training, with the main objective of familiarizing interviewers with the questionnaire, the context of the research and study purposes and limitations. During training they were instructed on how to approach the study subjects, emphasizing the voluntary, free and anonymous participation of respondents, and how to respond to questions and concerns of the participants. The team included 15 interviewers and 3 supervisors, plus a field coordinator. The team had extensive experience in prison studies, reflected in their education studies of undergraduate and masters specialized in Criminology: Social Work, Anthropology, Psychology and Sociology. During this first phase further efforts were made with the relevant authorities to achieve permanency in the centers studied, ensuring safety conditions for both interviewers and participants of the study. 2. Second phase: a pilot test was conducted in two centers in the Federal District to test the questionnaire, the clarity of language, and the extension. This test allowed to make changes to the questionnaire, and to calculate the percentage of \"no answers\". One of the key objectives of the pilot will be to test the possibility of an exit survey, which would have information on the immediate experience of the subjects. For the pilot surveys 30 surveys were conducted at two centers in the Federal District. The surveys used in the pilot were not used in the final results. 3. Third phase: field survey. Surveys were applied face to face to men and women, once they had completed their visits to the center; the survey was voluntary under the promise of anonymity. The surveys were conducted on Saturdays and Sundays. The collection in the Federal District employed 16 interviewers and 4 supervisors, and in Morelos, 14 interviewers and 4 supervisors. For the selection of the subjects a systematic sampling, with a random start, at each center, each day. (Ex. 2, 7, 9, 18, 22, 23, etc ... until completing the sample). Each day began with an initial random number. The field supervisor used a table of random numbers daily at each center to ensure random selection of subjects. Given the number of surveys conducted in different centers, the study does not allow comparison between centers, but it does allow comparison between states. The information processing was carried out simultaneously with the field survey. The sample was designed by Dr. Carlos Vilalta, Research Professor, Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), based on information about visitors provided by the authorities of each state. In both states, coordination was carried out by Dr. Catalina Pérez Correa and Dra. Maria Cristina Monta√±o.",

Is housing connected?, iv.\tIs housing green and sustainable?, v. Is housing a secure asset? Data has been compiled from the top four global databases: the Housing Finance and Information Network (HOFINET); Global Housing Policy Indicators (GHPI) of Habitat for Humanity International; United Nations: Compendium of Housing Statistics (UNCHS); and the World Bank World Development Indicators (WB-WDI). Further, data from national census agencies has been included and the platform includes indicators obtained from specific surveys collected in areas where data is not available. Some indicators are calculated from metadata contained in other sources. Notes and sources are included for every data point which explains where the data is from and, if applicable, how it was calculated. The indicators are presented in a format that allows for comparison across the national, metropolitan, and local levels wherever possible. However, it is the responsibility of the user to determine if it is appropriate to compare. The dataset contains the most recent data available to the working group and its partners.",

The availability of valid, comparable, and standardized public debt data is essential for the implementation of sound policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This is why at the core of the LAC Debt Group initiative is the development of a standardized sovereign debt database to help debt managers, policy makers, and other actors of financial markets analyze the evolution and composition of public debt in LAC and conduct cross-country comparisons. The information of this database is provided by the public debt offices of LAC countries in response to a questionnaire specifically designed to allow comparability of data. The questionnaire, whose response is non-compulsory, is intended to compile up-to-date standardized statistics for objective and homogeneous definitions of public debt.",

Each dimension has multiple factors which contribute towards a more mature state of cybersecurity capacity. Each factor then has several levels of indicators that describe a state of maturity (Startup, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic).

This year’s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development—physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional— does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children’s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.",

These pillars are broken down into components that track the maturity of institutional systems.

Thus, the structure of this questionnaire, forming the database, is based on the concept that there are five intervening elements in the process of public value creation, namely: 1) results-based planning, 2) results-based budgeting, 3) financial management, audit, and procurement, 4) program and project management, and, 5) monitoring and evaluation. These elements, called pillars of the management cycle, are broken down in a set of components that describe the maturity of the institutional systems. In turn, the components consist of indicators and requirements that these institutions, systems and processes should have in an MfDR environment. The questionnaire includes four kinds of requirements: those that measure compliance of a condition, those that indicate a percentage, the special cases, and those that request additional information. (1)\tRequirements that measure compliance are the predominant type of requirements in this questionnaire. The requirements that measure compliance specify the situation that must occur in order to be considered fully or partially compliant. However, some of these types of requirements do not include partial compliance, only fully compliance and non-compliance. (2)\tRequirements that measure percentages specify the calculation that should be performed. (3)\tThis questionnaire includes three requirements considered special cases because they are neither part of those that measure compliance, nor of those that measure percentages. All these cases are tha calculation of number of average days. (4)\tFinally, there are a very restricted number of requirements in which is asked to provide additional information. For example, the number of persons who work in an entity or unit.",

        "description": "This broad and novel database of 52 countries over 2001–11, allowed a study that assesses the link between financial intermediation and saving. The study finds that the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region lags well behind other regions in terms of financial depth, as measured by gross private domestic financial assets. LAC countries also have a larger share of bank deposits and cash in the private sector portfolio, compared to non-bank assets (bonds and shares). Moreover, within the institutional investor industry, pension funds are relatively developed in the region, although they grew out of the compulsory pension systems in several countries that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. The findings also indicate that LAC countries have about 40 percent of gross private financial wealth invested abroad, but just 4 percent of gross private liabilities have that origin, which attests to region’s obstacles in tapping international markets. The countries in general present a small share of household and business saving being intermediated through the financial system. In the specific case of bank deposits, just 5 percent of household saving and 3 percent of business saving are kept in the banking system.",

Each dimension has multiple factors which contribute towards a more mature state of cybersecurity capacity. Each factor then has several levels of indicators that describe a state of maturity (Startup, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic). The different levels of maturity listed prompt the respondent to select the level that is most applicable to the experience of cybersecurity in the country. The results of the analysis were then sent to each country for validation.

The IDBA is a powerful tool to identify the magnitude of the gap in two different geographic approached, first when we compare the state of the art of one country versus the cluster region the country belongs to, and second, when we compare the country with respect to the OECD. The IDBA relies on a comprehensive approach based on four pillars: infrastructure, applications and capacity, strategic regulations, and public policy and strategic vision. Those four pillars are built as a result of the combination of 37 indicators from renowned international institutions. As a result, the IDBA provides a tool for decision makers and policymakers to detect, on a country basis, strengths and areas for improvement in developing specific, concrete and actionable plans.",

This initiative has been promoted and financed by the Inter-American Development Bank - IDB through the Regional Public Goods program under the coordination and execution of CISALVA Institute at the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia. The citizen security indicators were designed, reviewed and approved by the project's partner countries, along with established definitions and methodologies for the standardizing of  the collecting, processing and analyzing stages of the information flow in order to support the quality of the data published. These indicators were reviewed in various regional boards, resulting in the improvement of some of them and the selection of additional citizen security indicators. The indicators are obtained via administrative records and others via surveys. In order to ensure the comparability of the indicators, a standardization process of concepts relating to the variables of time, place, person and circumstance was developed.",

In recent years, progress has been made towards increasing total revenue, but most countries in the region still lag well behind other countries with similar levels of development. More importantly, Latin America policymakers still largely ignore the potential of taxation to contribute to other important development goals. Governments have repeatedly missed the chance to influence consumption and production patterns by using taxes to effect relative price changes. More than Revenue aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the current state of taxation in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region, its main reform needs, and possible reform strategies that take into account the likely economic, institutional, and political constraints on the reform process.",

        "description": "The database allows estimating structural fiscal balances for 20 countries in the region under different assumptions regarding the output gap and commodity structural prices. It is a unique database of its kind since: 1) It takes into consideration the distinct responsiveness of different types of revenues to changes in the output gap: In order to adjust for the impact of the business cycle on revenues, we calculate individual elasticities for each source of revenue (i.e. direct taxes, indirect taxes, revenues from non-renewable resources, etc.). Since the different types of revenues in the region have different sensitivities to changes in the output gap, this disaggregated approach allows for a more fine-tuned adjustment. 2) It includes estimations of SFBs based on output gaps’ projections available in “real time”. In addition to giving estimations of the actual SFBs, we provide with estimations of the SFBs that would have resulted should the projections on output gaps available to policymakers at the time of designing fiscal policy (data in “real time”) have been correct. This is in contrast to much of the existing work on structural fiscal balances that makes only an “ex post” analysis using actual and revised information on the output gaps. 3) It allows assessing the response of fiscal policy to the business cycle. We provide with measures of the fiscal impulse, assessing not only the actual but also the intentional fiscal stance, as well as the degree of procyclicality of fiscal policy.",

The analysis and scores in the model provide a comparable assessment of individual countries' readiness and facility for PPP project design and implementation. For the purpose of this index, PPP refers specifically to projects which involve a long-term contract between a public-sector body and a private-sector entity for the design, construction (or upgrading), operation and maintenance of public infrastructure; with finance usually provided by, and significant construction, operation and maintenance risks transferred to, the private-sector, which also bears either availability or demand risk; but with the public sector remaining responsible for policy oversight and regulation; and the infrastructure generally reverting to public-sector control at the end of the contract term.",

These pillars are broken down into components that track the maturity of institutional systems. The components are in turn composed of indicators and minimum requirements that these systems must have in an MfDR environment. All of these measures (minimum requirements, indicators, components, and pillars) are scored on a scale from 0 to 5, where a 5 indicates an ideal institutional situation.",

The IDB supported the design of a methodology that evaluates critical points to assess the civil services and carried out country evaluations in 2004. Between 2011 and 2013, a second group of diagnostics second group of diagnostics were completed (with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank, and in the case of Central American countries and Dominican Republic with the support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development –AECID- and the Central American Integration System-SICA). Scores are available for 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 (year of second and/or third measurement varies per country). In 2015, 2017 and 2019, the IDB completed the third series of diagnosis. During the first assessment, 93 critical points were identified; each of those fed a subsystem and an index. In 2010 the methodology was simplified to 33 critical points and the base line was recalibrated to ensure comparability. The methodology is based in the identification of critical points that feed 8 subsystems: 1. Human Resources Planning, 2. Work Organization, 3. Employment management, 4. Performance management, 5. Compensation management, 6. Development management, 7. Human and social relations management, 8. HR Function organization; and 5 indexes: 1. Efficiency, 2. Merit, 3. Structural consistency, 4. Functional capacity, and 5. Integrating capacity.",
